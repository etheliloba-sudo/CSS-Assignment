        <h2>Who is Ebube?</h2>
        <p>Ebubechukwu "Ebube" Iloba is a promising, talented, young lady. She's as creative as she is intelligent, a first class graduate of Mass Communication from Pan-Atlantic University, and the most recent recipient of the school's Leadership Award. Like most geniuses, she has horrible handwriting. She is hilarious, witty, and an enigma-in-training. Ebube is a cradle Catholic, and enjoys theology whenever she can get her hands, eyes, and mind on it. Plus, she <b>loves</b> an em-dash, and an Oxford comma.

        <h3>Ebube loves to: </h3>
        <br>
        <em><u>Read and write</u></em>
        <p> An avid reader, and not-as-avid writer, she enjoys FICTION, happy to escape the realities of life in words and literary devices. She is currently reading "Shigidi and the Brass Head of Obalufon" by Wole Talabi</p>
        <br>
        <em><u>Listen to Music</u></em>
        <p> As a true escapist, one must find many means through which they can excape. As such, Ebube also enjoys listen to all sorts of music in shuffle. Currently, her go-to music era is the oldies; anywhere before the year 2000. However, her current favourite song is "Within" by Daft Punk</p>
        <br>
        <em><u>Eat</u></em>
        <p>Is there true happiness without food? Ebube doesn't intend to find out. She can be found snacking on full meals —or actual snacks— at any given time. She currently enjoys eating shawarma from Kilimanjaro</p>

        <h3>Ebube wants to:</h3>
        <br>
        <p>"Ms. Third ward, your first question – what is your aspiration in life? Oh... My aspiration in life... would be... to be happy"</p>
        <br>
        <p>These are the opening lyrics to Beyonce's song "Pretty Hurts". While she does not fit the description of many things in the song, Ebube does aspire to be happy. To feel free, unburdened, and at peace.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Ebube believes in the concept of fulfilment, and she is constantly pursuing it. Fulfilment looks like different things for different people, and while she doesn't yet know what it is for her, she is determined to find it.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Oh, and Ebube aspires to be wealthy!</p>
